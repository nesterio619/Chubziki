Online Documentation: https://inabstudios.gitbook.io/see-through-fx/
You can find more specific information on the asset functionality and setup process.

### IMPORTING

After downloading the asset, import the appropriate .unitypackage file based on your Unity version and SRP (either Built-in.unitypackage, URP.unitypackage, or HDRP.unitypackage).

### LEARN

The asset offers various options for see-through effects using custom-created effects, each with its own benefits and suitability for different scenarios. These effects can be freely combined as they are not dependent on each other.
Objects Fade: Fades out entire game objects when they are between the camera and the player.
Distance Fade: Fades parts of objects based on their distance from the camera.
Round See Through: Creates a round circular see-through effect through walls and objects.

Every feature has it's own example scene so you could easily see how it can be configured.

See Online Documentation for more specific tutorials.
